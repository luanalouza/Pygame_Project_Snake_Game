# Pygame_Project_Snake_Game
A classic Snake game developed in Python using the Pygame library. This project highlights my proficiency in Python programming and game development. Control the snake, collect food, and avoid collisions to grow and score points. Enjoy smooth controls, dynamic gameplay, and engaging visual effects.
